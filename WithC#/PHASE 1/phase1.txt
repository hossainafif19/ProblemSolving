PHASE 1 — BASIC LOGIC BUILDING
GOAL: Learn how to think step-by-step and decompose problems

--------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 1: Reverse a Number

Problem Statement:
Reverse a given positive integer.

Rules (Strict):
- No string conversion
- Use math only

Think Before Coding:
- How to extract last digit?
- How to build reversed number?

Your Task:
- Reverse digits using loop

Key Lesson:
- Digit extraction
- State transformation
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 2: Palindrome Number

Problem Statement:
Check whether a number is a palindrome.

Rules (Strict):
- No string conversion

Think Before Coding:
- How to preserve original value?
- What should be compared?

Your Task:
- Reverse number
- Compare with original

Key Lesson:
- Preserve state
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 3: Prime Number Check

Problem Statement:
Check whether a number is prime.

Rules (Strict):
- No built-in prime checks

Think Before Coding:
- What defines a prime number?
- When can we stop early?

Your Task:
- Check divisibility from 2 to N-1

Key Lesson:
- Early termination
- Correct loop boundaries
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 4: Fibonacci Series

Problem Statement:
Print first N Fibonacci numbers.

Rules (Strict):
- Loop only
- No recursion
- No arrays

Think Before Coding:
- What two values must be remembered?

Your Task:
- Generate Fibonacci iteratively

Key Lesson:
- State shifting
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 5: Armstrong Number

Problem Statement:
Check whether a number is an Armstrong number.

Rules (Strict):
- No string conversion
- Use math only

Think Before Coding:
- How many digits?
- How to compute power?

Your Task:
- Sum digit^count
- Compare with original

Key Lesson:
- Nested loops
- Generalized logic
--------------------------------------------------
