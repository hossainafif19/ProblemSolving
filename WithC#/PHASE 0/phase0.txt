PHASE 0 — PROGRAMMING WARM-UP
GOAL: Remove rust and rebuild basic logical thinking

--------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 1: Print Numbers from 1 to N

Problem Statement:
Given an integer N, print all numbers from 1 to N (inclusive).

Rules (Strict):
- Use loop only
- No built-in shortcuts

Think Before Coding:
- Where does counting start?
- Where does it stop?
- How many times will the loop run?

Your Task:
- Read N
- Print numbers from 1 to N

Key Lesson:
- Loop boundaries
- Counting logic
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 2: Sum of First N Natural Numbers

Problem Statement:
Given an integer N, calculate the sum from 1 to N.

Rules (Strict):
- Use loop
- Do not use formula

Think Before Coding:
- How will you accumulate values?
- What should the initial sum be?

Your Task:
- Read N
- Add numbers from 1 to N
- Print sum

Key Lesson:
- Accumulator pattern
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 3: Check Even or Odd

Problem Statement:
Check whether a given integer is even or odd.

Rules (Strict):
- Use modulus operator (%)

Think Before Coding:
- What does % 2 return?
- When is a number even?

Your Task:
- Read number
- Print Even or Odd

Key Lesson:
- Modulus operator
- Conditional logic
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 4: Find Maximum of Two Numbers

Problem Statement:
Given two integers, print the greater one.
If both are equal, print “Both are equal”.

Rules (Strict):
- Use if-else only

Think Before Coding:
- How many comparisons are needed?
- How to check equality?

Your Task:
- Read two numbers
- Compare and print result

Key Lesson:
- Conditional branching
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 5: Count Digits of a Number

Problem Statement:
Count how many digits an integer contains.

Rules (Strict):
- Do NOT convert to string
- Use division only

Think Before Coding:
- How do you remove the last digit?
- When should the loop stop?

Your Task:
- Read number
- Count digits using loop

Key Lesson:
- Integer division
- Loop termination
--------------------------------------------------
