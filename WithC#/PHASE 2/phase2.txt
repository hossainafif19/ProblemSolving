PHASE 2 — ARRAYS
GOAL: Build index-based problem-solving (interview foundation)

--------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 1: Find Largest Element in Array

Problem Statement:
Find the maximum element in an array.

Rules (Strict):
- No LINQ
- No sorting

Think Before Coding:
- What should be initial max?

Your Task:
- Traverse array
- Track maximum

Key Lesson:
- Proper initialization
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 2: Find Smallest Element in Array

Problem Statement:
Find the minimum element in an array.

Rules (Strict):
- Loop only

Think Before Coding:
- How to update minimum?

Your Task:
- Traverse array
- Track minimum

Key Lesson:
- Comparison logic
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 3: Reverse an Array

Problem Statement:
Reverse array in place.

Rules (Strict):
- No extra array

Think Before Coding:
- Which elements swap?
- When to stop?

Your Task:
- Use two-pointer logic

Key Lesson:
- In-place operations
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 4: Count Even and Odd Numbers

Problem Statement:
Count even and odd numbers in an array.

Rules (Strict):
- No LINQ

Think Before Coding:
- What makes a number even?

Your Task:
- Traverse and count

Key Lesson:
- Pattern selection matters
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 5: Find Second Largest Element

Problem Statement:
Find second largest distinct element.

Rules (Strict):
- No sorting
- No LINQ

Think Before Coding:
- Track two values
- Handle duplicates

Your Task:
- Maintain invariants

Key Lesson:
- Sentinel pitfalls
- Robust logic
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 6: Check if Array Is Sorted

Problem Statement:
Check if array is sorted in ascending order.

Rules (Strict):
- One pass

Think Before Coding:
- When can we say “Not Sorted”?

Your Task:
- Compare adjacent elements

Key Lesson:
- Early exit
--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 7: Check if Array Is Palindrome

Problem Statement:
Check whether array reads same forward and backward.

Rules (Strict):
- No extra array

Think Before Coding:
- Compare symmetric elements

Your Task:
- Use two-pointer logic

Key Lesson:
- Symmetry comparison
--------------------------------------------------
